# Scheduling-Application
Using JAVA, Maven project and MongoDB

   The system that we are designing is to create a meeting scheduler, where employees can create meetings and invite other employees to them. The invited employee can choose to either accept, decline, or respond to the invitation at a later time. If the invited employee does not re-spond the system will keep reminding the user to respond every time the user logins until the user accepts or declines the meeting invitation.

   The computerized part of our system includes notifications for the invited employee whenever they get invited to a meeting, and notifications for the host whenever an invited em-ployee accepts/declines their meeting invitation. Another computerized function is finding a time slot where all invited employees are available as well as checking if any rooms are availa-ble for booking during that time slot. Login verification is of course computerized, where we will check the employeeâ€™s username and password against their stored username and password in our database.

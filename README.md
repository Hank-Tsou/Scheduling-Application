# Scheduling-Application
Using JAVA, Maven project and MongoDB

   The system that we are designing is to create a meeting scheduler, where employees can create meetings and invite other employees to them. The invited employee can choose to either accept, decline, or respond to the invitation at a later time. If the invited employee does not re-spond the system will keep reminding the user to respond every time the user logins until the user accepts or declines the meeting invitation.
